ProPhyle
========

ProPhyle is a metagenomic classifier based on BWT-index and phylogenetic trees,
whose indexing strategy is based on the bottom-up propagation of genomesâ€™
k-mers in the tree, assembling contigs at each node and matching using a
standard full-text search. The analysis of shared k-mers between NGS reads and
the genomes in the index determines which nodes are the best candidates for
their classification.
