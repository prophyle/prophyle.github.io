Introduction
============

ProPhyle is a metagenomic classifier based on BWT-index and phylogenetic trees, whose indexing strategy is based on the bottom-up propagation of genomes' k-mers in the tree, assembling contigs at each node and matching using a standard full-text search. The analysis of shared k-mers between NGS reads and the genomes in the index determines which nodes are the best candidates for their classification.
